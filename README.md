# Network-security-and-privacy-for-two-factor-authentication-
 This project explores the present digital day with remarkable development in Computer sector, Single factor authentication, e.g. passwords, is no more examined as secure in the World Wide Web.Security comes in all shapes and sizes, ranging from problems with software on a computer, to the integrity of messages and emails being sent on the Internet. Network Security is a term to denote the security aspects attributed to the use of computer networks. This involves the protection of the integrity of the communications that are sent over the network, who is able to access the network or information system present, and also what can be sent over the network. There are a multitude of scenarios and areas that a network and its use can be exploited. The problem is that given the OSI Network Model of: Application, Transport,Network, Datalink and Physical, where amongst this can security be deployed? Should everything be concentrated at the data link or network or transportâ€¦ layers? or should a Defense in Depth strategy be employed? These notes details the various ways in which networks can be made secure. The remainder of this chapter provides some introductory material in relation to networks and their security.
